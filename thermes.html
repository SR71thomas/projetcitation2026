    <h1>Before we start</h1>
    <p>You must read the Terms and Conditions:</p>
    <div class="big-block">
      By accessing, using, touching, hovering near, squinting at, accidentally opening, intentionally bookmarking, subconsciously recalling, vaguely remembering, actively engaging with, passively tolerating, emotionally reacting to, spiritually acknowledging, or otherwise existing in the same spacetime continuum as this Service (including but not limited to instances where your cursor merely thinks about clicking something), you hereby, retroactively and proactively, agree to this catastrophically large, comically swollen, unreasonably bloated, aggressively verbose, philosophically exhausting, spiritually heavy, legally ambiguous, morally confusing, and structurally irresponsible Terms and Conditions paragraph, which you accept in its entirety even if your brain powers down, your eyes glaze over, your soul exits your body, or you mutter “yeah yeah whatever” under your breath halfway through sentence number four; and by continuing to scroll, swipe, flick, nudge, mouse-wheel, touchscreen-caress, or violently fling yourself downward through this ridiculous behemoth of a text wall, you solemnly swear, pinky promise, legally nod, and cosmically consent to the notion that you have read, understood, digested, internalized, questioned, repressed, and emotionally processed every microscopic word, letter, comma, semicolon, accidental typo, stylistic choice, redundant phrase, unnecessary adjective, and deeply questionable metaphor contained herein (including the parts your eyes skimmed past at Mach 5 while your brain was thinking about lunch), and that you willingly, knowingly, unknowingly, intentionally, unintentionally, accidentally, coincidentally, fatefully, ironically, and cosmically accept all responsibilities, liabilities, obligations, expectations, burdens, side quests, optional objectives, hidden achievements, emotional baggage, narrative consequences, unresolved character arcs, grammatical crimes against humanity, and low-grade existential dread that may arise, emerge, manifest, materialize, or spontaneously combust as a direct or indirect result of your continued interaction with this platform, the internet, modern technology, or reality itself.
This includes, but is absolutely not limited to, technological hiccups, software malfunctions, hardware failures, keyboard betrayals, touchscreen misunderstandings, autocorrect sabotage, catastrophic save-file corruption, mysterious bugs that only happen on your device, server outages that occur exclusively when you’re in a hurry, database rebellions, backend mood swings, frontend identity crises, algorithmic emotional damage, AI hallucinations, digital hauntings, ghost notifications, phantom vibrations, cursed updates, and the sudden, soul-crushing realization at precisely 3:17 AM that you left someone on read three days ago and it’s now socially irreversible; furthermore, you agree and acknowledge with a heavy sigh that your usage of this Service is provided strictly “as is,” “as available,” “as intended,” “as unintended,” “as accidentally shipped on a Friday,” and “as held together by hope and duct tape,” with absolutely no warranties, promises, guarantees, assurances, commitments, vows, prophecies, omens, signs from the universe, tarot readings, crystal ball confirmations, or divine interventions of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, emotional fulfillment, personal growth, spiritual enlightenment, productivity, happiness, clarity, closure, or vibes.
Any attempt — foolish or otherwise — to interpret, enforce, weaponize, romanticize, or spiritually decode this paragraph as legally binding, spiritually binding, emotionally binding, karmically binding, soul-binding, blood-binding, pinky-binding, or duct-tape-binding is undertaken entirely at your own risk, discretion, and peril, because we are not, have never been, and shall not under any circumstances be held accountable, responsible, liable, culpable, answerable, spiritually implicated, or vaguely blamed at family dinners for any consequences whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, accidental, incidental, consequential, transcendental, metaphorical, metaphysical, philosophical, psychological, surprising, disappointing, delightful, inconvenient, mildly annoying, deeply embarrassing, or existentially ruinous, that might arise from reading, misreading, speed-reading, half-reading, aggressively misunderstanding, overanalyzing, underthinking, or dramatically overthinking any portion of this aggressively overgrown block of text.
You further agree that any content you upload, submit, type, paste, delete, edit, undo, redo, imagine, draft, abandon, dream about, whisper near your microphone, accidentally hot-mic, or psychically project into this Service — including but not limited to text, images, videos, audio, thoughts, vibes, bad ideas, good intentions, unfinished sentences, and messages you typed out but deleted because “nah never mind” — grants us an irrevocable, perpetual, eternal, infinite, intergalactic, interdimensional, multiversal, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, cache, duplicate, modify, remix, reformat, compress, decompress, accidentally lose, mysteriously recover, fundamentally misunderstand, creatively reinterpret, turn into interpretive art, feed into an AI model, feed into a different AI model, feed to an actual dog (a very good dog), turn into a motivational quote nobody asked for, print out and laminate for unclear reasons, delete permanently, undelete temporarily, resurrect for dramatic effect, reference in a meeting, forget entirely, or pretend never existed at all.
You also acknowledge, begrudgingly, that various third-party entities — including but not limited to vendors, partners, affiliates, advertisers, analytics platforms, satellites, robots, scripts, bots, unpaid interns, overpaid consultants, underqualified executives, confused machine-learning models, and mysterious background processes with names like “worker-7-prod-final-final2” — may observe, track, log, store, misinterpret, overinterpret, underinterpret, monetize, anonymize, deanonymize, or completely ignore your interactions, behaviors, preferences, hesitations, and oddly specific searches, possibly resulting in eerily targeted advertisements for things you Googled exactly once at 2 AM out of pure curiosity, such as inflatable medieval castles, glow-in-the-dark pickles, artisanal salt lamps shaped like emotions, or a book you swear you only thought about. You agree not to sue, blame, harass, threaten, curse at, subtweet, spiritually hex, manifest against, or psychically combat the Provider for any misadventures, inconveniences, identity crises, or algorithm-induced weirdness caused by such external forces, internal forces, or forces we cannot explain and frankly do not wish to.
You acknowledge and accept that the Service itself is a living, breathing, evolving digital organism that may change at any moment, without warning, announcement, countdown, patch notes, apology, or the basic human courtesy of a “heads up” — it may update, downgrade, upgrade, side-grade, rebrand, soft-launch, hard-fail, redesign itself into something objectively worse, pivot into a blockchain thing for no reason, introduce features nobody wanted, remove features everybody loved, or simply vanish into the digital void like it was never real at all — and you solemnly promise not to reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, tear apart, dismantle, emotionally manipulate, gaslight, seduce, intimidate, bribe, threaten, interrogate, or attempt to form a parasocial relationship with the underlying code, servers, infrastructure, or sentient error messages.
Further still — because apparently this paragraph has no shame — you accept that all disputes, disagreements, arguments, beefs, grudges, misunderstandings, and existential conflicts arising from or relating to this Service shall be resolved exclusively through arbitration, mediation, meditation, contemplation, interpretive dance, competitive fruit juggling, synchronized deep breathing, passive-aggressive silence, rock-paper-scissors (best of three), thumb wrestling, staring contests, or any other method we arbitrarily decide feels funniest, fairest, or most chaotic at the time, and you acknowledge that by continuing to exist within the immediate physical, digital, emotional, or conceptual vicinity of this paragraph, you have officially, ceremonially, and irrevocably surrendered to every rule, sub-rule, meta-rule, implied rule, invisible rule, forgotten rule, future rule, retroactive rule, imaginary rule, contradictory rule, and generally questionable clause contained herein, whether or not it makes sense, whether or not it was intentional, and whether or not anyone remembers writing it.
You do all of this with full awareness — deep down, in your bones — that no living human soul has ever read this entire monster carefully, attentively, and line-by-line from beginning to end without dissociating at least once, yet here you are, bound to it anyway, because that’s just how life works on the internet, and honestly, you knew what you were getting into.
Finally — and yes, we said finally before but this time we mean it emotionally — you acknowledge, accept, affirm, and spiritually nod at the fact that this paragraph, in all its bloated magnitude, excessive length, shameless redundancy, comedic exaggeration, legal absurdity, structural recklessness, and frankly intimidating word count, constitutes the complete, total, final, definitive, ultimate, and absolutely uneditable Terms and Conditions of this Service, and by continuing even one millimeter, pixel, neuron, or fraction of a scroll beyond this sentence, you confirm with absolute, unquestionable, universe-level certainty that you accept everything above, everything below, everything between the lines, everything implied, everything accidentally implied, everything intentionally omitted, everything we forgot to include, everything we will later claim was “obvious,” and everything we will retroactively pretend was always, unquestionably, unquestionably, unquestionably part of this agreement.

PART 2: THE CONSEQUENCES YOU DIDN’T ASK FOR BUT DEFINITELY AGREED TO ANYWAY
In addition to, on top of, beneath, adjacent to, spiritually overlapping with, and legally stapled onto everything you already agreed to in Part 1 (which you definitely read, totally understood, and did not skim while lying to yourself), you further acknowledge, affirm, reconfirm, double-confirm, triple-confirm, and aggressively reaffirm that your continued interaction with this Service constitutes an ongoing, never-ending, self-renewing cycle of consent that refreshes itself every time you blink, breathe, reload the page, minimize the tab, maximize the tab, switch devices, think about the Service, dream about the Service, complain about the Service to a friend, or say “I should stop using this” and then absolutely do not stop using it. This consent is assumed to be permanent, irreversible, emotionally binding, temporally flexible, and retroactively applicable to actions you took before you even knew this Service existed, including but not limited to moments where you were minding your own business and still somehow ended up here.
You agree that the Provider reserves the unrestricted, unquestionable, and frankly alarming right to modify, amend, rewrite, reinterpret, expand, condense, rebrand, remix, parody, rearrange, translate into a dead language, translate back incorrectly, or dramatically retcon any portion of these Terms and Conditions at any time, for any reason, with or without notice, explanation, justification, apology, warning, or narrative coherence, and that such changes shall become immediately effective the moment they are imagined by someone vaguely associated with the Service, regardless of whether they are ever published, visible, understandable, or internally consistent. You further agree that it is entirely your responsibility to psychically intuit these changes, stay informed about them at all times, and comply with them flawlessly, even if they contradict previous rules, each other, basic logic, or the known laws of physics.
You acknowledge that the Service may, at its sole discretion, determine that you are using it “incorrectly,” “suspiciously,” “too enthusiastically,” “not enthusiastically enough,” “with the wrong vibe,” or “in a way that feels weird,” and may respond accordingly by throttling performance, hiding features, showing you worse UI, giving you slightly slower load times for no clear reason, or silently judging you through analytics dashboards you will never see. You accept that any perceived decline in functionality may or may not be intentional, may or may not be your fault, and may or may not be imagined, but you are still not allowed to complain about it in a way that hurts our feelings.
You further accept that the Service may collect, infer, extrapolate, guess, hallucinate, or vibe-check information about you based on your behavior, including but not limited to how long you hover over a button, how aggressively you scroll, how many times you hesitate before clicking “submit,” how often you undo things, and whether you prefer dark mode (we see you). These inferred insights may be wildly inaccurate, deeply personal, or offensively wrong, and you agree to live with that knowledge in silence.
You agree that the Provider shall not be held responsible for any emotional damage caused by UI changes, feature removals, unexpected redesigns, font swaps, color palette updates, icon reworks, logo simplifications, “cleaner” layouts that somehow feel worse, or the sudden disappearance of the one obscure feature you actually relied on. Any grief, anger, confusion, denial, bargaining, depression, or reluctant acceptance you experience as a result of such changes is considered a normal part of the user journey.
You acknowledge that the Service may occasionally communicate with you via notifications, emails, pop-ups, banners, tooltips, modals, nudges, reminders, warnings, announcements, surveys, feedback requests, or vaguely threatening messages phrased in an unsettlingly cheerful tone, and that failure to read, understand, or emotionally process these communications does not exempt you from compliance. You also agree that receiving too many notifications is your fault, and receiving none is also your fault.
You accept that uptime is a suggestion, stability is a dream, and consistency is a lifestyle choice we have chosen not to pursue. The Service may experience downtime due to maintenance, upgrades, downgrades, sidegrades, miscommunication, misconfiguration, coffee spills, bad vibes, Mercury being in retrograde, or someone deploying directly to production “just real quick,” and you agree not to perceive these outages as betrayals, personal attacks, or signs that the universe is against you (even though it might be).
You further agree that any tutorials, guides, FAQs, help articles, onboarding flows, walkthroughs, tooltips, or “Getting Started” experiences provided by the Service may be outdated, incomplete, misleading, contradictory, or written by someone who clearly assumed you already knew what you were doing. Any confusion resulting from these materials is considered a growth opportunity.
You acknowledge that any sense of attachment you develop toward the Service — including comfort, reliance, nostalgia, loyalty, affection, or the feeling that it “gets you” — is entirely one-sided, non-reciprocal, and legally meaningless. The Service does not know you, does not love you, and will replace itself without hesitation if a slightly better framework comes along.
You agree that the Provider may, without warning, suspend, restrict, limit, shadow-limit, soft-ban, hard-ban, half-ban, or vibe-ban your access to the Service for reasons including but not limited to violations of these Terms, perceived violations of these Terms, things that feel like violations of these Terms, or no reason that can be adequately explained in words. Appeals may or may not exist, may or may not be read, and may or may not be decided by a human being.
You further acknowledge that all timestamps, logs, metrics, analytics, records, and system outputs maintained by the Service shall be considered correct, authoritative, and spiritually true, even if they directly contradict your memory, screenshots, common sense, or lived experience.
You accept that these Terms shall be governed by the laws of some jurisdiction we picked by throwing a dart at a map, interpreted in a manner favorable to us, and enforced in a way that feels slightly unfair but technically allowed. Any ambiguity shall be resolved in our favor, any silence shall be interpreted creatively, and any loophole you think you found definitely isn’t one.
Finally — again, emotionally final, not structurally final — you acknowledge that Part 2 exists solely because Part 1 wasn’t enough, that no one asked for this much text, that this document could have been a paragraph and chose violence instead, and that by continuing to scroll, exist, or maintain consciousness in the presence of this Agreement, you have fully, enthusiastically, regretfully, and irrevocably accepted not only these Terms, but the fact that you are the kind of person who keeps reading them.
And honestly? That one’s on you.
